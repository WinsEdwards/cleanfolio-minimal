        <h1>Hello, I am <span class="about__name">O. Winslow Edwards, MPH.</span></h1>
        <h2 class="about__role">Full Stack Developer and Public Health Professional.</h2>
        <p class="about__desc">
          I entered the field of software development after six years of public health research management, intrigued with the ability of technology to create novel solutions to complex health challenges. After completing a 6 month intensive at <a class="link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://adadevelopersacademy.org/">Ada Developer's Academy</a>, I joined the CX-Business Enablement team at <a class="link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.homechef.com/">Home Chef</a> for a 5 month full stack engineering internship, where I quickly gained expertise with Ruby and Ruby on Rails, React.js, PostgreSQL, agile methodologies, and the ticket lifecycle.
        </p> 
        
        <p class="about__desc">
          With my diverse experience in research project management, consulting, and full-stack software engineering, I am confident that my acumen, passion, and personability will drive my success and make me an asset to any team. I am eager to bring my skillset to a new opportunity that leverages technology to support health, wellness, and joy - let's connect and explore how we can grow together!
        </p>

        <btn class="about__accordion">About Me (Extended Cut)</btn>
        <div class="about__panel">
          <p class="about__panel__desc">
            During my time in public health research, I managed various studies exploring wellness within historically marginalized communities including 
            <a class="link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=LGBTQIA2S%2B">LGBTQIA2S+</a> people, people living with HIV (PLHIV), and Black, Indigenous and People of Color <a class="link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=black+indigenous+and+people+of+color">(BIPOC)</a>. Some of my projects explored the impacts apps could have in increasing access to sexual healthcare and providing medication reminders, while others leveraged existing software to deliver questionnaires exploring sexual health and well-being. In these roles, I coordinated cross-functional teams, organized all aspects of advertising and recruitment for 18,000+ participants, helped to design and program survey tools, and reported study findings.
          </p>

          <p class="about__panel__desc">
            Noticing the ways that technology could help rural <a class="link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=LGBTQIA2S%2B">LGBTQIA2S+</a> folks locate an affirming doctor or PLHIV to order their medications for home delivery inspired me to make a career shift. I was accepted to <a class="link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://adadevelopersacademy.org/">Ada Developer's Academy</a>, where I studied full-time for six months and grew expertise with Python, Pytest, Flask, Javascript, React.js, Vue.js, PostgreSQL, and Postman. I acquired the technical knowledge necessary to build innovative, software-based approaches to address public health gaps and support well-being and demonstrated my knowlege with the completion of my capstone project, <a class="link" href="#projects">Provide</a>.
          </p> 
        
          <p class="about__panel__desc">
            Most recently, I have been fortunate to complete a five month internship at  <a class="link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.homechef.com/">Home Chef</a>. As a member of the the CX-Business Enablement team, I have increased my proficiency with Ruby, Ruby on Rails, RSpec, Javascript, React.js, Haml, Yarn, and PostgreSQL, gaining experience iteratively writing code and unit tests, refactoring legacy code, debugging, and engaging in the full ticket lifecycle from creation to PR review to closure. I have worked on Netsuite integrations, user ability modifications, payment intents, and data privacy features to align our website with federal and state privacy regulations. Throughout my internship, I've also gained familiarity with Agile methodologies and technical collaboration via pair programming, demonstrating a knack for creative problem solving and efficient time management.
          </p>

          <p class="about__panel__desc">
            Throughout my career, I have combined my passion for public health with my technical expertise to drive impactful projects that support well-being and joy. From managing large-scale research studies to developing software solutions that support privacy rights, I have demonstrated my ability to organize cross-functional teams, work efficiently with teammates, design innovative tools, and navigate complex technical challenges.

              When Home Chef users switched from another payment method to Apple Pay on the mobile app, their Apple Pay email was not displaying and the message to the user needed changes.

                Winslow did a great job quickly picking up Ruby on Rails and understanding how their team works with the Customer Support team. This allowed Winslow to make an immediate impact as they were able to simplify key Customer Support workflows. This resulted in Customer Support agents being able to complete actions more quickly, helped us maintain Home Chef’s industry-leading customer support, and led to many emojis of thanks from their teammates. 
                
              <p class="reference__description">  
                Of note, before the internship, Winslow had little experience with our main testing frameworks - Rspec and React Testing Library. They did a fantastic job diving into tutorials, working closely with their teammates, and understanding the existing patterns within the codebase to quickly upskill. This resulted in Winslow’s tickets always having complete and well-scoped tests enhancing the health of our codebase. It was a joy to work with Winslow. We are devastated that we can not continue at Home Chef and are envious of whoever gets to work with them next.

                I had the pleasure of working with Winslow during their internship at Home Chef. They consistently demonstrated the ability to ramp up on new technologies and exhibited a great work ethic. Winslow quickly adapted to our development environment, contributed meaningful code to our projects, and was always eager to learn and take on new challenges. Their ability to collaborate effectively with the team and their proactive approach to problem-solving made them a valuable asset. Winslow has a bright future in software development and would be a great addition to any team.

                Mx. Edwards is exceptional at delivering results for the studies they manage. This is above expectations because the position they were hired into didn't require management of the studies, but rather implementation. They not only took on this role after departure of the prior study director, but has also excelled at the work. Mx. Edwards has rapidly developed a new set of skills for recruiting, enrolling, and managing study participants. They exceed expectations in using those newly acquired skills.

              <p class="reference__description">  
                They are proactive for identifying potential problem areas and communicates in advance with partners that may be impacted by them. In the rare situations in which problems do arise such as with IRB approvals, engaging a newcommunity advisory board, or study enrollment, they have been quick to communicate the problem, seek solutions, and implement them. This approach is consistent with expectations from very senior project director-level staff.
